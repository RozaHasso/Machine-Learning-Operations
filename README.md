1. Dataset: Cats and Dogs image classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification
whcih consists of 697 files/images of cats and dogs.

2. The  project goal:  The goal of the project is to classify a given image whether it includes a cat or a dog object, we want to create a structure repository to train a neural network model 
logging the results and the performance with reproducible  experiments. 

3. Framework: We are using Pytorch Image Models TIMM, because it includes the necessery classes and code for initilizing the neural network model. 

4. Deep Learning Model:   We are using the Neural Network NN model to classify cats and dogs images
